I decided to start a new blog site to write more about systems programming and distributed systems. I'm planning to
write a short blog post about writing Redis Modules in C. I may publish it in a few days. 

Actually I have many potential blog post ideas to write about Golang and distributed systems. But I don't have enough
time to write them carefully. 

Anyways. I'll come back!
