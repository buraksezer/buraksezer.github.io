I decided to start a new blog to write more about systems programming and distributed systems. I'm planning to
write a short post about writing Redis Modules in C. I may publish it in a few days. 

Actually I have many potential blog post ideas to write, but I don't have enough time to write them down carefully. 

Anyways. I'll come back!
